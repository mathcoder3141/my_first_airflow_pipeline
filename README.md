# My First Data Pipeline

For my first time ETL (Extract, Transact, Load) piepline, I'll be writing some code to extract weather data from the OpenWeather API for the city of Dallas, Texas. 

The objective of this project is to demonstrate my experience with Apache Airflow in an efficient manner to grab data from an API and assemble my own custom dataset.
